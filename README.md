The data delivery and sharing process, usually based on CD/DVD-ROM or on shared network environment (Internet, LAN, WAN etc), provides the user with a digital version of the remote sensing data and images. In the same way as for multimedia contents, the digital format implies an inherent risk of unauthorized copy or use of the product. Similarly many digital services, such as Medical, Military, and Space imaging systems require reliable security in storage and transmission of digital images. The rapid progress of Internet in the digital world today, the security of digital images has become more and more important. The prevalence of multimedia technology in our society has promoted digital images to play a more significant role, which demands a serious protection of usersâ€Ÿ privacy. To fulfill such security and privacy needs in various applications, encryption of images is very important to minimize malicious attacks from unauthorized parties.
